## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features
1. Create components in appropriate directories
2. Use established patterns for forms and API calls
3. Follow the existing naming conventions
4. Add proper error handling and loading states
5. Update seed data if needed

### Database Operations
```javascript
// Use DatabaseService for all operations
import { DatabaseService } from '../services/database';

// Create
const job = await DatabaseService.createJob(data);

// Read
const jobs = await DatabaseService.getJobs(filters);

// Update
const updated = await DatabaseService.updateJob(id, changes);

// Delete
await DatabaseService.deleteJob(id);
```

### API Integration
```javascript
// Use MSW handlers for API simulation
import { rest } from 'msw';

// Add new endpoints to handlers.js
export const newHandlers = [
  rest.get('/api/new-endpoint', async (req, res, ctx) => {
    // Implementation
  }),
];
```
